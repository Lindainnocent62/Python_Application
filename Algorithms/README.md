Bridging the Gap: Understanding Algorithms Through the Lens of Math, Science, and Engineering
In today's world, data-driven decision-making is central across industries—from engineering to finance, from healthcare to logistics. At the heart of this transformation lie algorithms—structured sets of rules or steps used to analyze, compute, model, and predict behavior. My goal is to understand not only how algorithms work, but why they work, and when to use them, by examining the mathematical, statistical, and scientific principles that form their foundation.
